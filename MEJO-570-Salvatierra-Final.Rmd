#Overview: This data interview builds off of a series of New York Times investigations into JROTC programs nationwide, attempting to assert the finding that JROTC programs have a “heavy concentration in schools with low-income and nonwhite students,” the consequence of which The New York Times reports is, “help[ing] propel such students into the military instead of encouraging other routes to college or jobs in the civilian economy.” This analysis' scope is limited to the "low-income" assertion within North Carolina. Using geospatial data, this analysis maps North Carolina school districts and locations of high schools with JROTC programs to identify the number of programs per district using points and polygons available through the sf package. Then, using The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates from 2022, this analysis identifies the number of districts with a child poverty rate (for children aged 5-17) above the national child poverty rate in 2022 of 16.3 percent. These districts are then measured against the number of JROTC programs within their respective district to see if they have a disproportionate concentration of programs, identified as more than one per district. Finally, using the leaflet package to create an interactive map, the JROTC programs are plotted to compare their locations relative to urban areas such as major cities versus rural parts of the state. 

#Findings: No direct conclusions can be drawn from this analysis to confirm or refute the assertion made by The New York Times as further controls and context are needed, such as the total number of high schools and students per district. But a few key observations were made. 1) Out of the 80 out of 118 districts identified with childhood poverty rates above the national average, only 23 districts have more than one JROTC program. This is fewer than anticipated considering the initial assertion of a "heavy concentration" in low-income areas. As for geographic concentrations in rural versus urban areas, the programs are relatively evenly distributed across the state when accounting for major cities and their larger student populations respectively.
